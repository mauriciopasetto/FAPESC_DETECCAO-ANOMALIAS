The data of this project includes two main monitoring data (set of activities/actions) of a person monitored during one year.

The data are generated using a pseudo Markovian model using 7 transition matrices.
The "/Graphs" folder of this project includes the transition matrices in SVG and PNG formats.

Graph files are:
namesTransition_XX.XX_YY.YY_ZZZ.format presents the Markovian matrices with states (activities) names
codesTransition_XX.XX_YY.YY_ZZZ.format presents the Markovian matrices with states (activities) codes

XX.XX: the starting time of the monitored period
YY.YY: the ending period of the monitored period
ZZZ: indicates whether the period concerns any day of the week (ZZZ=Week) or a specific day (ZZZ=Friday/Sunday)
format: is the file format (PNG or SVG)


The file "activity_action_codes.txt" gives the different activity/actions and their codes.

Data files :
monitoringP1HRversion.txt : human readable version of one-year monitoring of a person belonging to the same SMAF* profile P1
monitoringP1CDversion.txt : coded version of one-year monitoring of a person belonging to the same SMAF profile P1
monitoringPxHRversion.txt : human readable version of one-year monitoring of a person where the dependency level was changing
monitoringPxCDversion.txt : coded version of one-year monitoring of a person where the dependency level was changing


* Functional Autonomy Measurement System (SMAF) is a clinical rating scale that measures the functional autonomy of elderly patients.
